# Discover and Manage Farms

## Motivating scenario

A farm is separated to 4 land sections: The first two land sections grow crops of type wheat, and they are of square shape of length 1, characterised by their opposite corners at point coordinates [0,0],[1,1] and [1,0],[2,1] respectively. The other two land sections grow crops of type corn, and they are of square shape of length 1, characterised by their opposite corners at point coordinates [0,1],[1,2] and [1,1],[2,2] respectively.  

Each crop type has a required moisture level: Once the moisture level of crops falls under the required one, the crops should be irrigated.  The required moisture levels of wheat and corn are 120 and 80, respectively. 

The farm contains two tractors that can be controlled within the coordinates of the farm’s land sections: One tractor offers an action affordance for reading the current moisture level of the farms’ land sections, and one tractor offers an action affordance for irrigating the farm’s land sections.  

The tractors are operated by two autonomous agents: An agent that monitors the current moisture levels of land sections, and an agent that irrigates land sections.
